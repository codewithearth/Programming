There are other combinations of two FDs giving at least 6 coins — for example, the first and third (for 4+5=9) and third and fourth (for 5+1=6), but there is no way to open only one FD and get 6 or more coins.\n","\n","**Test case 2:** No matter which FDs Chef opens, he cannot have ≥15 coins, so the answer is −1 — even if he opens all of them, he will have only 1+5+3=9 coins.\n","\n","**Test case 3:** Chef can open the first FD to obtain 10 coins, which is larger than the 5 coins he needs.\n","\n","**Test case 4:** Chef can open the third and fourth FDs to get 3+4=7 coins, which is enough because he needs 7 coins."],"metadata":{"id":"lGZlMuwuSmG_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Code:**"],"metadata":{"id":"F4BIlaYpYI71"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iuU0xQPXSlYZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1642411564265,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":44439,"user":{"displayName":"Prince Kumar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhMTxIzQb2V9pB3DoLmeSS4sVEmXrvfrpAikwqx=s64","userId":"04752223120631466680"}},"outputId":"2f84ac30-24cd-42de-b4a0-642ec831e297"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["4 \n","4 6\n","4 3 5 1\n","2\n","3 15\n","1 5 3\n","-1\n","1 2\n","10 3\n","1\n","4 7\n","1 2 3 4\n","2\n"]}],"source":["# Create function\n","def fix_dop(c,d):\n","\n","    #sort the list from largeest to smallest\n","    d.sort(reverse = True)\n","    \n","    # take two temp variables\n","    f = 0\n","    g = 0\n","\n","    # iterate over the sorted list\n","    for i in d:\n","\n","        # put values in temp variables\n","        f+= i\n","        g+=1\n","\n","        # if temp variable is equal or grater then input number\n","        # then return second temp varible\n","        if f >= c:\n","            return g\n","\n","    # otherwise return -1\n","    return -1\n","\n","# input the size of test case\n","a = int(input())\n","\n","#iterate for each test case\n","for i in range(a):\n","\n","    # input numbers and list \n","    b,c = map(int, input().split())\n","    d = list(map(int, input().split()))\n","    \n","    # pass the number and list in function and print the answer\n","    print(fix_dop(c,d))"]}]}
