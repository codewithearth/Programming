There are three subjects in this series: DSA, TOC, and DM. Each subject carries 100 marks.\n","\n","You know the individual scores of both Dragon and Sloth in all 3 subjects. You have to determine who got a better rank.\n","\n","The rank is decided as follows:\n","\n","* The person with a bigger total score gets a better rank\n","* If the total scores are tied, the person who scored higher in DSA gets a better rank\n","* If the total score and the DSA score are tied, the person who scored higher in TOC gets a better rank\n","* If everything is tied, they get the same rank.\n","\n","##**Input Format**\n","\n","* The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n","* The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers denoting the scores of Dragon in DSA, TOC and DM respectively.\n","* The second line of each test case contains three space-separated integers denoting the scores of Sloth in DSA, TOC and DM respectively.\n","\n","##**Output Format**\n","\n","* For each test case, if Dragon got a better rank then output \"Dragon\", else if Sloth got a better rank then output \"Sloth\". If there was a tie then output \"Tie\". Note that the string you output should not contain quotes.\n","* The output is case insensitive. For example, If the output is \"Tie\" then \"TiE\", \"tiE\", \"tie\", etc are also considered correct.\n","\n","\n","##**Constraints**\n","\n","* 1≤T≤1000\n","* Each score of both Dragon and Sloth lies between 0 and 100.\n","\n","##**Subtasks**\n","**Subtask #1 (100 points):** Original constraints\n","\n","##**Sample Input 1 **\n","```\n","4\n","10 20 30\n","30 20 10\n","5 23 87\n","5 23 87\n","0 15 100\n","100 5 5\n","50 50 50\n","50 49 51\n","```\n","\n","##**Sample Output 1 **\n","```\n","SLOTH\n","TIE\n","DRAGON\n","DRAGON\n","```\n","\n","##**Explanation**\n","\n","* For the first test case, Sloth and Dragon have the same total score but Sloth gets a better rank because he has a higher score in DSA.\n","* For the second test case, Sloth and Dragon have the same rank because they have the same score among all subjects.\n","* For the third test case, Dragon gets a better rank because he has a greater total score.\n","* For the fourth test case, Sloth and Dragon have the same total score and same DSA score. Dragon gets a better rank because he has a greater TOC score."],"metadata":{"id":"XC6wW4iGK3ZA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Code:**"],"metadata":{"id":"wmqwEKWhLp2i"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CxCaFEjMKrQm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1642258687419,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":51475,"user":{"displayName":"Prince Kumar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhMTxIzQb2V9pB3DoLmeSS4sVEmXrvfrpAikwqx=s64","userId":"04752223120631466680"}},"outputId":"62930d7a-9db1-4fa9-8b12-4b2f586ec9df"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["4\n","10 20 30\n","30 20 10\n","SLOTH\n","5 23 87\n","5 23 87\n","TIE\n","0 15 100\n","100 5 5\n","DRAGON\n","50 50 50\n","50 49 51\n","DRAGON\n"]}],"source":["# create a function \n","def exam(n,m):\n","\n","    # if \"DRAGON\"'s score is greater, then return \"DRAGON\"\n","    if sum(n) > sum(m):\n","        return \"DRAGON\"\n","\n","    # if \"SLOTH\"'s score is greater, then return \"SLOTH\"\n","    elif sum(n) < sum(m):\n","        return \"SLOTH\"\n","\n","    # if both condition is false then run this block\n","    else:\n","\n","        # if \"DRAGON\" got high marks in DSA then return \"DRAGON\"\n","        if n[0] > m[0]:\n","            return \"DRAGON\"\n","\n","        # if \"SLOTH\" got high marks in DSA then return \"SLOTH\"\n","        elif n[0] < m[0]:\n","            return \"SLOTH\"\n","\n","        # if \"DRAGON\" got high marks in TOC then return \"DRAGON\"\n","        elif n[1] > m[1]:\n","            return \"DRAGON\"\n","\n","        # if \"SLOTH\" got high marks in TOC then return \"SLOTH\"\n","        elif n[1] < m[1]:\n","            return \"SLOTH\"\n","\n","        # if both score is equal in all subject then return \"TIE\"\n","        else:\n","            return \"TIE\"\n","\n","# Input the size of test case\n","a = int(input())\n","\n","# iterate the input a times\n","for i in range(a):\n","\n","    # Input the marks of \"DRAGON\" and \"SLOTH\"\n","    n = list(map(int, input().split()))\n","    m = list(map(int, input().split()))\n","\n","    # call the exam function and print output\n","    print(exam(n,m))"]}]}
